        "This method is mainly to deal with large categories. Use to reduce the number of observations in large categories to balance the data set. It is suitable when the overall data set is large, and this method can also reduce the calculation time and storage overhead (the training set samples are less). It is also possible to combine the two methods of oversampling and undersampling. The large class uses undersampling without replacement, and the small class uses oversampling with replacement."

        "The synthetic data sampling method uses artificial data instead of repeating the original observations to solve the imbalance. Among those algorithms, ASMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) is the most common a data sampling technique.\n",
        "SMOTE works by selecting examples that are close in the feature space, drawing a line between the examples in the feature space and drawing a new sample at a point along that line.\n",
        "Specifically, a random example from the minority class is first chosen. Then k of the nearest neighbors for that example are found (typically k=5). A randomly selected neighbor is chosen and a synthetic example is created at a randomly selected point between the two examples in feature space.\n",
        "This procedure can be used to create as many synthetic examples for the minority class as are required. As described in the paper, it suggests first using random undersampling to trim the number of examples in the majority class, then use SMOTE to oversample the minority class to balance the class distribution.\n",
        "The approach is effective because new synthetic examples from the minority class are created that are plausible, that is, are relatively close in feature space to existing examples from the minority class.\n",
        "A general downside of the approach is that synthetic examples are created without considering the majority class, possibly resulting in ambiguous examples if there is a strong overlap for the classes."

        "Sometimes the dataset we use to solve a problem contains a lot of missing values that can adversely affect the performance of a machine learning model. A dataset with a lot of missing values can give us wrong information. So if we have missing values in a dataset, here are some strategies we can choose to deal with them:\n",

        "- Filling the missing values according to the other known values\n",
        "\n",
        "The first strategy is to remove the entire row containing a missing value. This is not a bad idea, but it can only be considered when the data is very large. If removing missing values results in a data shortage, then this will not be an ideal dataset for any data science task. This is where the second strategy comes in, which is to fill in the missing values according to the other known values. This strategy can be considered in any type of dataset.\n",

If implemented with Sklearn, then this encoder should be used to encode output values, i.e. y, and not the input X. It is similar to the ordinal encoder except, here the numeric values are assigned automatically without following any sort of natural order. Generally, the alphabetical order of the categorical values is used to determine which numerical value comes first. Considering our target variable “Job Status” column has four different categories. After applying label encoding to this column the four different categories are mapped into integers 0: Full Time, 1: Intern, 2: Part-Time, and 3:Unemployed. With this, it can be interpreted that Unemployed have a higher priority than Part-Time, Full Time, and Intern while training the model, whereas, there is no such priority or relation between these statuses. We can’t define the order of labels with the label encoding technique."

If there aren’t outliers, you’ll definitely gain some other insights like correlations, variability, or external factors like the impact of world war/recession on economic factors.
