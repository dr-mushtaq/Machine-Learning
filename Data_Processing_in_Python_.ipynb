        "Sometimes the dataset we use to solve a problem contains a lot of missing values that can adversely affect the performance of a machine learning model. A dataset with a lot of missing values can give us wrong information. So if we have missing values in a dataset, here are some strategies we can choose to deal with them:\n",

        "- Filling the missing values according to the other known values\n",

        "The first strategy is to remove the entire row containing a missing value. This is not a bad idea, but it can only be considered when the data is very large. If removing missing values results in a data shortage, then this will not be an ideal dataset for any data science task. This is where the second strategy comes in, which is to fill in the missing values according to the other known values. This strategy can be considered in any type of dataset.\n",

If implemented with Sklearn, then this encoder should be used to encode output values, i.e. y, and not the input X. It is similar to the ordinal encoder except, here the numeric values are assigned automatically without following any sort of natural order. Generally, the alphabetical order of the categorical values is used to determine which numerical value comes first. Considering our target variable “Job Status” column has four different categories. After applying label encoding to this column the four different categories are mapped into integers 0: Full Time, 1: Intern, 2: Part-Time, and 3:Unemployed. With this, it can be interpreted that Unemployed have a higher priority than Part-Time, Full Time, and Intern while training the model, whereas, there is no such priority or relation between these statuses.

        "These extreme values need not necessarily impact the model performance or accuracy, but when they do they are called “Influential” points. Many machine learning models, like linear & logistic regression, are easily impacted by the outliers in the training data.Models like AdaBoost increase the weights of misclassified points on every iteration and therefore might put high weights on these outliers as they tend to be often misclassified. This can become an issue if that outlier is an error of some type, or if we want our model to generalize well and not care for extreme values.To overcome this issue, we can either change the model or metric, or we can make some changes in the data and use the same models [5]"

This assumption is discussed in the Z-Score method section below."
