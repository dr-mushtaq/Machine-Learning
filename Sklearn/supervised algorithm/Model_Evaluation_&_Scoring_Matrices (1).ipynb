        "## 8.3 ROC Curves\n",
        "ROC(Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve helps better understand the performance of the model when handling an unbalanced dataset. ROC Curve works with the output of prediction function by setting different threshold values to find out different false positives and true positive rates according to the threshold. In the case of SVC, for example, a threshold set for output of decision function is 0 whereas ROC Curve tries various values for thresholds like [2,1,-1,-2] including negative threshold values as well. In the case of LogisticRegression, the default threshold is 0.5 and ROC will try default threshold values. For linear regression, the output is a probability between [0,1] hence threshold is set at 0.5 to differentiate positive/negative classes whereas in case of SVC internal kernel function returns value and threshold is set on that value for making a prediction.\n",
